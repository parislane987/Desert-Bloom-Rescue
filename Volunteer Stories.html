    <h3>Volunteer Story – Carol</h3>
            <p style="color: #000000">"I never knew the full extent of the challenges exotic animals face until I started volunteering at Desert Bloom Rescue. I initially signed up just to help my community a bit, but after meeting animals like Benny, I had a revelation that I wanted to learn more about things like the illegal exotic pet trade and the importance of preserving wildlife. I've become more involved with educational programs, speaking to schools and local communities about animal conservation. Every day at Desert Bloom is a new opportunity to learn, grow, and make a difference." - Carol</p>

            <h3>Volunteer Story - Jon</h3>
            <p style="color: #000000">"I’ve always had a love for animals, but I never realized how much of a difference I could make until I started volunteering at Desert Bloom. I began by feeding and cleaning some enclosures but soon found myself connecting with the animals on a deep level. One of my most memorable experiences was with Ziggy, who was afraid of human contact after suffering abuse. It took plenty of patience and time, but I was finally able to earn his trust and form an incredible relationship with him. Volunteering here has given me the chance to make a difference in these animals' lives -- and mine." - Jon</p>
